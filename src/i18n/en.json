        "text": "Transcription completely changed my approach to learning English. Before, I often couldn't understand what native speakers were saying — everything blended into one stream. But when I started listening to audio with transcription, words and expressions began forming into understandable phrases. I started noticing how sentences are built, how real conversational expressions are used. This gave me confidence and greatly improved my listening comprehension. Now I don't just listen — I truly understand.",

        "text": "I often record interviews on a voice recorder — and transcription used to take tons of time and nerves. With transcription everything became easier: I upload audio and in a minute I have ready text. This really saves me, especially when deadlines are tight. Plus it's convenient to reread and find the right quotes. Now I spend more time on the essence — not on rewinding recordings back and forth.",
